# Pre-Launch Landing Page

This is just a very simple template to start collecting leads and beta users as soon as possible while you work on your startup.

## Development

### Recommendations

Install a simple hot reload server so you can see changes refreshed automatically in the browser window

```sh
npm install -g simple-hot-reload-server
```

Optionally, create an alias so you just have to type `serve` in the future.

```sh
echo "alias serve='open http://localhost:8082 && hrs'" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```
